* On the heels of Bitcoin’s sporadic rise between 2009 and 2013, Rostand became increasingly aware of the industry. In 2014, he was attracted to the idea of allowing others to share his enthusiasm for digital assets.It took a lot of hours to set up the infrastructure and all of the software, which had to be built from the ground up,” said Rostand to MaRS. “I carried my notes with me everywhere, working out of coffee shops. Mundane coding and testing took days. If I had to do it again, I’d start out with a business partner right away, instead of trying to do everything myself."
* Luckily, Rostand’s efforts were not in vain. 2017 brought massive changes for the platform he built, with Coinsquare raising $30 million in venture capital funding.
* Piszel’s vision is to see it become a fully regulated broker dealer offering a variety of services, while still leading the way in digital currencies
* Crypto traders, retail traders
* Coinsquare charges a maker fee of 0.1% and a taker fee of 0.2%. QuickTrade fees are 0.2% for a single conversion rate and 0.4% for a double conversion rate. This fee structure is clear and concise in comparison to other crypto exchanges like Coinfield and Coinbase.
